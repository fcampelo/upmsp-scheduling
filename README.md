## 1. Problem description

Given a set N = {1, ..., n} of n jobs and a set M = {1, ..., m} of m parallel machines, each job j in N has to be processed on exactly one machine k in M. The machines are unrelated, i.e., the processing time of a job depends on the machine to which it is assigned to. Moreover, setup times dependent on the sequence and machine are considered. In this work, the objective is to minimize the makespan, i.e., the time of completion of the last job to leave the system.
